This repository is the official implementation of "[UWSAM: Segment Anything Model Guided Underwater Instance Segmentation and A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset]()".

If you found this project useful, please give us a star ⭐️ or [cite](#citation) us in your paper, this is the greatest support and encouragement for us.

## :speech_balloon: Updates
🚩 **News** (2025.05) We propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, [UIIS10K](#datasets), which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. As far as we know, this is **the largest underwater instance segmentation dataset** available and can be used as a benchmark for evaluating underwater segmentation methods.

## Datasets
The dataset follows the COCO format and is organized as follows:
```
    data
      ├── UIIS10K
      |   ├── annotations
      │   │   ├── multiclass_train.json
      │   │   ├── multiclass_test.json
      │   ├── img
      │   │   ├── train_00001.jpg
      │   │   ├── ...
      │   │   ├── test_00001.jpg
      │   │   ├── ...
```
you can get our UIIS10K dataset in [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WwDu_jYV8JsPvOGA2l6raQ?pwd=UIIS) (pwd:UIIS) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MYQwWrQW_n9N-q_VPMuQaroIp5gS2f-u/view?usp=sharing).
